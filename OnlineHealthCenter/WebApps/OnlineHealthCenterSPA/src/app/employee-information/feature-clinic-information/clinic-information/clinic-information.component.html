    Online Health Center is an organized medical service primarly focused on the well-being of our patients. In 2002, we designed this first family-oriented, membership-based medical facility that combined evidence, empathy, and a curated list of medical specialists.  Our Health Center was born from a genuine desire to build a new model using our medical expertise, the best of what the hospitality industry had to teach us.
    Our team of over 135 physicians, nurses, medical concierge, and support staff work passionately to provide a full-service, five-star medical service emphasizing prevention, proactivity, and excellent health outcomes.  We are tech-savvy and embrace safe, effective medical innovation.
    Health Center is offering diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventive outpatient services to all of our patients.
